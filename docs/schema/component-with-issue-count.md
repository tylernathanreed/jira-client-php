# Component With Issue Count

Details about a component with a count of the issues it contains.

Source: [`Jira\Client\Schema\ComponentWithIssueCount`](/src/Schema/ComponentWithIssueCount.php)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assignee` | `User` | The details of the user associated with `assigneeType`, if any. See `realAssignee` for details of the user assigned to issues created with this component. |
| `assigneeType` | `'PROJECT_DEFAULT'\|'COMPONENT_LEAD'\|'PROJECT_LEAD'\|'UNASSIGNED'\|null` | The nominal user type used to determine the assignee for issues created with this component. See `realAssigneeType` for details on how the type of the user, and hence the user, assigned to issues is determined. Takes the following values:

 *  `PROJECT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the project the component is in.
 *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the component.
 *  `UNASSIGNED` an assignee is not set for issues created with this component.
 *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the default assignee for the project that the component is in. |
| `description` | `string` | The description for the component. |
| `id` | `string` | The unique identifier for the component. |
| `isAssigneeTypeValid` | `bool` | Whether a user is associated with `assigneeType`. For example, if the `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but the component lead is not set, then `false` is returned. |
| `issueCount` | `int` | Count of issues for the component. |
| `lead` | `User` | The user details for the component's lead user. |
| `name` | `string` | The name for the component. |
| `project` | `string` | The key of the project to which the component is assigned. |
| `projectId` | `int` | Not used. |
| `realAssignee` | `User` | The user assigned to issues created with this component, when `assigneeType` does not identify a valid assignee. |
| `realAssigneeType` | `'PROJECT_DEFAULT'\|'COMPONENT_LEAD'\|'PROJECT_LEAD'\|'UNASSIGNED'\|null` | The type of the assignee that is assigned to issues created with this component, when an assignee cannot be set from the `assigneeType`. For example, `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but no component lead is set. This property is set to one of the following values:

 *  `PROJECT_LEAD` when `assigneeType` is `PROJECT_LEAD` and the project lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.
 *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` when `assignee`Type is `COMPONENT_LEAD` and the component lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.
 *  `UNASSIGNED` when `assigneeType` is `UNASSIGNED` and Jira is configured to allow unassigned issues.
 *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` when none of the preceding cases are true. |
| `self` | `string` | The URL for this count of the issues contained in the component. |
